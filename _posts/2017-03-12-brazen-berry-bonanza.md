For the 7drl game jam this year, I made a small game called Brazen Berry Bonanza. It's a real-time kinda-roguelike where you move around on a grid, attempting to grow as many berries as possible while preventing other, evil berries from ripening. I think it turned out rather well. I might write some more about my thoughts on the game and the process of its design later, but for now it's playable for web [here](https://ethanhoeppner.github.io/gameFiles/BrazenBerryBonanza), or for windows (with source code) [here](https://ethanhoeppner.github.io/gameFiles/BrazenBerryBonanza/BrazenBerryBonanzaWindows.zip).
