A few months ago I made a game for the 7DRL game jam called Brazen Berry Bonanza, and it turned out well enough that I decided to continue working on it. I'm happy to announce that I've gotten the game to a point where I'm willing to call it an officially releasable game, and the game is now available for windows on [itch.io](https://ethan-hoeppner.itch.io/brazen-berry-bonanza), and for android on the [google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ethanhoeppner.brazenberrybonanza&hl=en).

I plan to continue working on this game for some time. There are already several big changes I want to make, which I'll likely talk about at some point on this blog.
